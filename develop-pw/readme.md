## Password Generator##

-- I decided to do this assignment from scretch when I spent quite a bit time
to review the study works. The assignment was issued before the API 
section was taught. After the API class I gave up the coding I already did
that was based on the basic JS methods.

-- I applied the DOM element querying, functions and js methods that I just
learned to make the coding more clean.

-- All special characters are inclued although some of them may not be ideal
for password.

-- The given HTML and style sheet have been modified to make more appealing.

-- Issue: When the Symbol is seleted and clicking the Generate Password button
too fast, occasionally, the symbol would get lost. When click the button again,
it would come back to normal. Not sure if this is due to the brower or the special
characters code problem.
